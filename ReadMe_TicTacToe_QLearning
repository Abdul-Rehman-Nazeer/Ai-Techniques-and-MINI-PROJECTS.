Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that enables an agent to learn how to make decisions to maximize cumulative rewards through trial and error.

Key Concepts:
Agent: The decision-maker.
Environment: The world the agent interacts with.
State: The situation of the agent.
Action: A choice made by the agent.
Reward: Feedback given to the agent based on its actions.
Q-value: A value that represents the expected future reward for taking an action in a given state.
Q-learning Process:
Q-table: Initially, the Q-values for each state-action pair are set to zero.

Exploration vs. Exploitation: The agent balances exploring new actions (random moves) and exploiting learned knowledge (best-known actions).

Update Rule: The Q-value is updated based on the reward received and the best future Q-value:

Q(s,a)=Q(s,a)+Œ±[R+Œ≥ a ‚Ä≤maxQ(s‚Ä≤,a‚Ä≤)‚àíQ(s,a)]
Where ùõº is the learning rate, 
ùõæ is the discount factor, and 
R is the reward.

Convergence: With enough exploration, the Q-values converge to the optimal values, allowing the agent to follow the best policy.

Advantages:
Works without prior knowledge of the environment (model-free).
Flexible and simple to implement.
Can be used in various environments.
Disadvantages:
Can be slow for large or complex state spaces.
Needs careful management of exploration to learn effectively.
